# SER

## The research area of the project
The research area of our problem is Signal processing. It is a
fundamental ield that transforms raw data into meaningful information, and
this is why it is both interesting and important, especially in our project on
speech emotion recognition. This
domain has a lot of real-world applications such as using it in the
social networks as a content-oﬀering system. For example, platforms can
analyse users' speech patterns to tailor content or detect mood shifts,
potentially improving user experience and even identifying early signs of
mental health issues. We consider it is amusing and useful area to work with.

## Aim of the project and tasks to achieve
The aim of our project is to convert raw sound waves into structured
data that can be e ectively analysed for emotion recognition. To achieve this,
we will leverage advanced linear algebra techniques, as each moment of
sound consists of hundreds of thousands of characteristics. Our approach
involves iltering and isolating the most signi icant features— using di erent
methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbour, Decision Tree etc. — to reduce
the data’s complexity without losing critical information.
Once we have extracted these key features, we will develop a model for
an algorithm that can pick up on small emotional signals in speech.
Overall, SER can improve how we interact with computers, help social
networks suggest content, analyse feelings in real-time, and even monitor
mental health.
